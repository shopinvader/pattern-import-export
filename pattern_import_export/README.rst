Overview
~~~~~~~~

This module extends the import/export capabilities of Odoo.

Patterns are simply a type of ir.exports model, so you can define them with the native Odoo widget to define export lists.

This module only create a common data structure. Other modules will be used to add specific file type support like excel and csv.


Features
--------

* Key matching: instead of always using IDs, match keys to unique-constrained fields, for example update a product by
  specifying its product_code instead of its database ID or external ID

* One2many and Many2many support: create or update for example invoice lines with a syntax that is very readable and easy to update

* As long as you respect the appropriate format and field names, you are free to add/remove/rename columns, even if they
  are not in the initial Pattern used for the export

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

* Install another module that supports a specific file type
* Use the Patterns menu to configure your import/export formats

Usage
=====

Configuring a pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First you have to define a pattern:

1. Go on the Import/Export->Patterns menu
2. Create your pattern with fields to export

You can refer to the examples in demo data.


Exporting
---------
* Open the tree view of any model and tick some record selection boxes.
* In the sidebar, click on the "Export with Pattern" button
* Select the pattern that you wish to use, click export and download the generated file.
* A "Pattern file" is created, and its job along with it. Depending on the success or failure of the job,
  you will receive a red/green notification on your window.


Importing
---------
You have two options:

* Open the tree view of any model and tick some record selection boxes (for this step, these don't matter, we only just want to show the sidebar).
* In the sidebar, click on the "Import with Pattern" button
* Select the pattern that you used to generate the export, upload your file and click import.
* A "Pattern file" is created, and its job along with it. Depending on the success or failure of the job, you
  will receive a red/green notification on your window. You can check the details in the appropriate Import/Export menu.

Or:

* Access the Import wizard through the Import/Export menu
* Select the Pattern that you want to use
* Click on the "Import" button

Example
-------

Here is an example of a simple update on ``product.product``:
Existing record:

- id: 10
- name: "Product 1"
- default_code: "PRD1"

The generated export will look like:

+---------------------+-----------+--------------+
| id                  | name      | default_code |
+=====================+===========+==============+
| 10                  | Product 1 | PRD1         |
+---------------------+-----------+--------------+

Updated file

+---------------------+---------------+--------------+
| id                  | name          | default_code |
+=====================+===============+==============+
| 10                  | Product 1-bis | PRD1B        |
+---------------------+---------------+--------------+

After import, our record will have been updated:

- xml id: "__export__.product1"
- name: "Product 1-bis"
- default_code: "PRD1B"

Now, let's update some relational fields. Here is some more of our starting data:

- seller_ids:

 - id (of the seller_id which is a res.partner): 22
 - name (seller): Partner 1
 - price: 10

The generated export should be like

+---------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| id                  | name      | default_code | seller_ids|1|id      | seller_ids|1|price |
+=====================+===========+==============+======================+====================+
| 10                  | Product 1 | PRD1         | 22                   | 10                 |
+---------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------------+--------------------+

Let's say "ref" is a unique-constrained Char field. For the seller, instead of using its id, let's use its ref.

+---------------------+-----------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------------+
| id                  | name      | default_code | seller_ids|1|ref#key      | seller_ids|1|price |
+=====================+===========+==============+===========================+====================+
| 10                  | Product 1 | PRD1         | partner1-ref              | 10                 |
+---------------------+-----------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------------+

So this ``#key`` means that Odoo should search for a ``res.partner`` where the ref matches the cell value.

Lets take another example, instead of using the id, we want to use the product's default_code as key.

+---------------------+-----------+------------------+---------------------------+--------------------+
| id                  | name      | default_code#key | seller_ids|1|ref#key      | seller_ids|1|price |
+=====================+===========+==================+===========================+====================+
|                     | Product 1 | PRD1             | partner1-ref              | 10                 |
+---------------------+-----------+------------------+---------------------------+--------------------+

Odoo will search the product with the matching ``default_code`` and update it.


Technically
~~~~~~~~~~~
Add a new export format
-----------------------
1. Inherit the ``ir.exports`` model.
2. Add your new file format in the selection field ``export_format``;
3. Implements functions ``_export_with_record_<format>`` and ``_read_import_data_<format>``.

Please take care of iterators (``yield``) to avoid loading full file into the system memory.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Unticking the "Use tab" boolean should clear the previously selected tab_filter_id
* Changing a line's field should clear the previously selected tab_filter_id
